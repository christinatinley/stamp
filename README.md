## stamp

stamp is an AI-powered itinerary travel assistant tool- aiming to ease the travel planning process into one seamless experience. Users take a short quiz to let stamp know what their preferences are including, but not limited to, location, dates, cuisine preferences, level of interests in different activities, etc. Once 
the quiz has been completed, stamp provides an itinerary for the desired trip.
